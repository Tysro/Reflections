When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    	When you want to collaborate your project with different developers, also when you want to share your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
		Sometimes even after few commits, your local repository won't be ready to update that changes on a remote repository or public repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
		Fork is used to copy a repository in github .Fork also acknowledge from which original repository it has been copied . So i has information about the original owner .Clone is used to copy from remote to local or copy within the local repository.
		When we use fork the original creator know about us having a copy .
		Branch is used when we want to do something new in our project like a new feature,fixing a bug.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
		We can resolve conflict if any by merging manually and push it into the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
		By mailing the new line of code.Definitely git, github method is easier for collaborating code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
		If you are having more than one contributor, to avoid conflicts we can create a new branch and send a pull request so that others can easily see what all changes has been made. Why we need a branch is beacuse we can always maintain a stable master and can experiment new feature or bug fixes on a separate branch without effecting the current stability of the master.
