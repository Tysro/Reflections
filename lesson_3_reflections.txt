When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    	When you want to collaborate your project with different developers, also when you want to share your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
		Sometimes even after few commits, your local repository won't be ready to update that changes on a remote repository or public repository.
